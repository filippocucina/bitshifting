Bit Shifting

If you multiply, then the operations will move/shift the numbers to the left

	253 * 10 = 2530
	418 * 1000 = 418000

If you divide, then the operations will move/shift the numbers to the right

	458 / 10 = 048
	820 / 1000 = 000
	172 / 100 = 001

This applies to base 10 and of course base 2.
